# Technical Guide: Setting Up Akamai Account Protector with PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps required to integrate Akamai Account Protector with PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud (AIC). The goal is to inject the `akamai-user-risk` custom HTTP header into the PingOne AIC authentication journey and use a Scripted Decision Node to assess risk levels.

By following this guide, the authentication journey will:
- Extract the `akamai-user-risk` header from requests.
- Parse the risk score provided by Akamai Account Protector.
- Determine the outcome (High, Medium, Low, No Score, or Error) based on predefined thresholds.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- Akamai Account Protector configured for your application.
- Akamai Edge DNS and CDN settings accessible.
- PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud (AIC) administrative access.
- Experience with PingOne AIC Authentication Policies and Scripted Decision Nodes.
- Knowledge of JavaScript for modifying the authentication script if needed.

## Step 1: Configure Akamai Account Protector
Akamai Account Protector detects malicious activities and assigns risk scores to requests. To inject the `akamai-user-risk` header, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Enable Account Protector on the Akamai Edge
1. Log in to Akamai Control Center.
2. Navigate to Security Configuration and select your existing security policy or create a new one.
3. Enable Account Protector under Bot Management settings.
4. Ensure that risk scoring is enabled and that Akamai will add the `akamai-user-risk` HTTP header.

### 1.2 Add the PingOne AIC Username Parameter to Akamai Account Protector
1. In the Akamai Control Center, create an API Definition to PingOne AICâ€™s hostname.
2. Add an API Resource with the following:
    - **Name:** Authenticate
    - **Path:** `/am/json/realms/root/realms/alpha/authenticate`

3. Check the `POST` method and set the Request parameters as such.
4. And the Response parameters as such:

The JSON/XML Schema should be set to the following:

```json
{
  "requestBody": {
    "content": {
      "application/json": {
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": [
            "callbacks"
          ],
          "properties": {
            "callbacks": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "input": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                      "type": "object",
                      "properties": {
                        "name": {
                          "type": "string"
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              },
              "description": "callbacks"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "application/xml": {
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": [
            "callbacks"
          ],
          "properties": {
            "callbacks": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "input": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                      "type": "object",
                      "properties": {
                        "name": {
                          "type": "array",
                          "items": {
                            "type": "string"
                          },
                          "maxItems": 1
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              },
              "description": "callbacks"
            }
          },
          "xml": {
            "name": "root"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "required": true
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Configure PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud
Once Akamai is injecting the `akamai-user-risk` header, configure PingOne AIC to utilize this risk information in the authentication journey.

### 2.1 Create an Authentication Policy
1. Log into PingOne Admin Console.
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Policies**.
3. Create a new policy or edit an existing authentication journey.
4. Add a Scripted Decision Node to the flow.

### 2.2 Configure the Scripted Decision Node
1. In the authentication journey, click **Add Node** and select **Scripted Decision Node**.
2. Paste the following JavaScript into the node:

```javascript
/* Script to retrieve the akamai-user-risk custom HTTP header and return a risk-based outcome */

var HIGH_SCORE = 50;
var MEDIUM_SCORE = 25;

try {
    var riskHeader = requestHeaders.get("akamai-user-risk");

    if(riskHeader != null) {
        var riskString = riskHeader.get(0);

        var riskArray = riskString.split(';')
        var scoreArray = riskArray[3].split('=');
        var score = Number(scoreArray[1]);

        nodeState.putShared("score", score);

        if(score > HIGH_SCORE) {
            outcome = "High";
        } else if(score > MEDIUM_SCORE) {
            outcome = "Medium";
        } else {
            outcome = "Low";
        }
    } else {
        outcome = "No Score";
    }
} catch(e) {
    outcome = "Error";
}
```

3. Save and validate the script.

## Step 3: Use Risk Score in Authentication Decisioning
Now that the Scripted Decision Node extracts the risk score, you can configure the authentication policy to act based on risk levels.

### 3.1 Define Authentication Flow Based on Risk Score
- **High Risk (High):** Redirect to additional multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Medium Risk (Medium):** Allow login but prompt for additional verification.
- **Low Risk (Low):** Allow seamless login.
- **No Score:** Fallback to additional multi-factor authentication.
- **Error:** Log the event and alert security teams.

## Step 4: Validate the Setup
After implementing the integration, perform the following tests:

### Test with a Known Good User
- Verify the `akamai-user-risk` header is present.
- Ensure authentication completes smoothly.

### Check Logs and Debug
- Use PingOne logs to verify the script execution.
- Enable Akamai logging to capture risk scores.

## Conclusion
By integrating Akamai Account Protector with PingOne AIC, you can enhance authentication security using real-time risk assessments. The injected `akamai-user-risk` header allows PingOne AIC to make dynamic authentication decisions, reducing fraud risks while maintaining a smooth user experience.
